## GIS and Historical Mapping Resources for W2415: Immigrant New York

Final Assignment, Option 3: Develop a map (or set of maps) and accompanying research paper where you explore themes from the course in relation to the spaces of historical New York City in which they occurred. Draw on historic maps, primary materials, available historic census data, and other sources to construct an argument, or narrate a series of events, spatially.

This might involve: tracking the locations mentioned in course readings and related primary sources and then overlaying these on historical maps from the period. It could also involve using historic census data from the National Historic GIS project (https://www.nhgis.org), or historic census micro data from the IPUMS project (https://usa.ipums.org/usa/complete_count.shtml) to investigate a course thematic in relation to a particular neighborhood or set of neighborhoods. Your project might investigate questions such as: how did successive immigrant waves co inhabit New York neighborhoods? What is the geography of key landmarks cited in primary texts?

Your task with this assignment is to investigate what new insights might be gleaned by considering space as an active agent in shaping historical trajectories.

You might craft a project where you annotate historic maps through a digital or physical collage, or, if you are interested in using a greater number of data sources, a project that requires the use of open source geographic information systems (GIS) software, QGIS (https://www.qgis.org).  

A number of resources are available to you as you complete this work.


### Online Tutorials for QGIS:
* [Center for Spatial Research GIS and Data Vizualization Tutorials](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/tutorials) including the materials in the `introductory_tutorials` [folder](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/gis_resources/tree/master/immigrant_new_york_spring18/introductory_tutorials) in this repository.

* [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/?topic=mapping)

### Workshops:
* [Columbia Research Data Services (Formerly The Digital Social Sciences Center)](http://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services/events.html) holds several introductory GIS workshops each semester. Their schedule should be posted very soon after the start of each semester.
### Office Hours:
* [Columbia Research Data Services](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/dssc.html) also offers walk-in office hours and project consultations by appointment.

### Data Resources:
The following are a few links to major resources for researching digitized historic map collections and historic census data.

* Columbia University Libraries, specifically the [Digital Social Sciences Center,](http://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html) at Lehman Library:
	* [GIS and Spatial Data Research Guide](http://guides.library.columbia.edu/c.php?g=715646&p=5092264)
	* The DSSC is the home of the [Lehman Map Collection](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/maps/about.html)
	* [GeoData @ Columbia](http://geodata.cul.columbia.edu) is a tool for searching Columbia's spatial data holdings including historical maps, by location.
	* [Durst Old York Library](https://dlc.library.columbia.edu/durst) at Avery contains scanned and geotagged maps, postcards, images and other NYC-focused arhival material

* [NYPL Space / Time Directory Project](http://spacetime.nypl.org/)
	* You can access historical spatial data on NYC at the Space / Time directory project, including building footprints from the 1850s, NYC Ward boundaries from 1703 to 1895, historical street centerlines (from 1850 to 1919), and the results of crowdsourced digitzation projects, including geolocated [Emigrant Savings Bank real estate records](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/#/).

**Scanned Historical Maps**
* [New York Public Library Map Division](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2014/03/28/open-access-maps)
	* Maps can be viewed through the [NYLP Digital Collections](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/search/index?filters%5BphysicalLocation_mtxt_s%5D%5B%5D=Map+Division&keywords=&sort=dateDigitized_dt+desc) and largely consist of [fire insurance and property atlases](https://www.nypl.org/collections/nypl-recommendations/guides/fire-topo-property-maps) which are very useful resources for the kind of mapping you may want to carry out on this project
	* They can also be viewed through the [NYPL Map Warper](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/)
	* or you can search through NYPL's scanned and referenced map collection by location on this [map-based site](http://spacetime.nypl.org/maps-by-decade/#/)

* [David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com)

**Historic Census Data**
* [NHGIS Historic Census data](https://www.nhgis.org)
* [IPUMS Full Count Census Microdata](https://usa.ipumsorg/usa/complete_count.shtml)
